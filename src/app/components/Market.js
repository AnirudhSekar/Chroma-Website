                1 in 3 Americans suffer from everyday wounds, burns, and diabetic
                ulcers, often realizing too late that an infection has developed.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                The problem? Current infection detection methods are expensive
                and inaccessible. Blood tests, lab cultures, and electronic
                sensors are costly and require trained professionals. ChromaCare
                solves this with a low-cost solution anyone can use.

              With antibiotic resistance on the rise and healthcare costs
              skyrocketing, early infection detection is more critical than ever.

              in healthcare by providing real-time infection detection for
